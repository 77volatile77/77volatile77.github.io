## STM32 USB Audio DAC


# Intro
Recently, I've been learning a bit of signals & systems, and it seems pretty cool. I've always wanted an excuse to do a mixed-signal hardware design, so I initially thought of building a guitar pedal to implement some effects -- but I don't have nor do I care to buy a guitar, so I don't think I'll try doing that for a while. I was never really into the audiophile stuff, but I like the sound of building one of those audio DACs. I know of these pretty affordable IEM's, the Moondrop Quarks. They sound pretty good, and they're like 16Î© impedance so pretty easy to drive. 

ok gonna test how this looks, pushing changes now.
