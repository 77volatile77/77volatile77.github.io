## STM32 USB Audio DAC


# Intro
I've always wanted an excuse to do a mixed-signal hardware design, so I thought of building a guitar pedal to implement some effects -- but well, I faked my way through band class for the entirety of middle school so that's not super optimal. What about a DAC? I was never really into the audiophile stuff, but I like the sound of building one of those audio DACs. I don't really know much about audio so this'll be a great opportunity to learn. 

# Goals
For now, I just wanna get something working quickly. I think I'll consider this initial experiment a success if this DAC sounds... ok? As long as there arent artifacts that ruin the listening experience. It's worth noting that it's pretty hard to test this stuff, since audio analyzers are like upwards of $20k. Jonathan Fisher's blog covered this topic as well -- and he seemed to be able to get rough results with his Saleae. Also, learn USB Audio and DMA, since I've actually never used DMA in a proper project. I'm a bit busy doing electronics on CWRU Baja, but it should be a fun challenge getting something done by the end of the semester. At the VERY LEAST, I can get this done by the start of next semester.

# What do?
OK, there are multiple ways to do this. Generally, the overall system just takes USB Audio data and transfers it via I2S to the audio stage, which should just be a DAC and Amp chip I think. The easiest way would be to use a USB-I2S bridge, which would remove the need for a microcontroller altogether, but that's no fun. What I'll do is just have USB IN, use STM32's SAI to handle I2S/DMA for the DAC, leading to the amplifier stage (stereo out). 

# MCU
I like STM32 since theyre relatively cheap, have tons of peripherals, perform well, and they just work. As far as families go, I just need something with I2S, SAI, USB (not crystal-less though, since timing for audio is a bit more critical). I think RAM is a parameter here (something to do with USB audio devices), if my browsing on this topic indicates anything. I've had good experiences with L431, but I'll keep looking. 

# Audio IC's 
I initially thought of using those fancy chips in commerical DAC's, like ES9038Q2M or AK4490 (ESS and AKM seem to be the popular ones), but these chips are either overkill or arent available. From what I've seen, PCM5102A (often paired with TPA6120A2 amplifier) seems like a popular choice amongst other people doing DIY DACs, as well as MAX98357, which is also a class D amplifier. Let's figure out what we're gonna use:

# DAC
In the spirit of simplicity, I'll forgo the crazy audiophile rated DACs out there and go for something simple: [PCM5102A](https://www.ti.com/product/PCM5102A). I've seen videos of it working and it sounds nice. I don't really wanna get hung up on choosing parts for now.

# Amplifier
Ok, so what do I want for this? For starters, I'd like to drive a 16Ω load at the lowest: I heard theres a rule of thumb that your amp output must be 1/8th of your headphones' impedance? so 2 ohm out? well, it doesnt really matter since the ones on the TI site are rated for a minimum output load, so I can just search 16Ω for that. Besides that, something really nice would be volume control. Doing a parametric search on the TI site, I get: [TPA6130A2](https://www.ti.com/product/TPA6130A2).

This chip seems to have it all: good price, availability, power (>= 100 mW is plenty for now), seems easy to implement, and I don't have to physically set gain. Nice. Only thing I don't like is that it's a WQFN.

# Final Thoughts
To be honest, the more I think about using ST's USB Middleware to do this, the less I want to use a microcontroller at all -- I'm kinda warming up to the idea of just using a bridge IC, since that will enable me to get this first project done ASAP. Not to mention, I won't even be doing DSP on the incoming audio, so thats even less of a reason for compute. Although, removing the µC does present one issue: I'd have to change the amp chip, since that uses I2C for volume control. Probably not much of an issue, since I can use another amp with settable gain and just use a pot / [baxandall control](https://resources.altium.com/p/baxandall-volume-control-audio) to set volume. For now, I think I'll keep what I have and just read a bunch of example code for the middlware stuff.
