## STM32 USB Audio DAC


# Intro
I've always wanted an excuse to do a mixed-signal hardware design, so I thought of building a guitar pedal to implement some effects -- but well, I faked my way through band class for the entirety of middle school so that's not super optimal. What about a DAC? I was never really into the audiophile stuff, but I like the sound of building one of those audio DACs. I know of these pretty affordable IEM's, the Moondrop Quarks. They sound pretty good, and they're like 16Î© impedance so pretty easy to drive. 

# Goals
Again, I'm not really an audiophile, so I think I'll consider this initial experiment a success if this DAC sounds... ok? As long as I don't notice any artifacts that ruin the listening experience, I suppose. I'll consider more objective stuff in future revisions, although it's worth noting that it's pretty hard to test this stuff, since audio analyzers are like $20k? Jonathan Fisher's blog covered this topic as well -- and he seemed to be able to get rough results with his Saleae. Also, learn USB Audio and DMA, since I've actually never used DMA in a proper project. Lastly, I actually want to try to get this done by the end of the semester (~Dec 20). Given the fact that I'm also doing hardware design for CWRU Baja at the moment, that might be a bit hard, but I'll give it a shot I guess.

# What do?
OK, there are multiple ways to do this. Generally, the overall system just takes USB Audio data and transfers it via I2S / DMA / SAI (stm32 audio perihperal) etc to the audio stage, which should just be a DAC and Amp chip I think. The easiest way would be to use a USB-I2S bridge, which would remove the need for a microcontroller altogether, but that's no fun. What I'll do is just have USB IN, use STM32's SAI to handle I2S comms with the DAC, and an Amp (ok im getting ice cream will edit later)
